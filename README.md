# Task 4 â€” Classification with Logistic Regression

##  Objective
Build a binary classification model using logistic regression on the Breast Cancer dataset.

##  Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

##  Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the Breast Cancer dataset.  
2. Split data into training and testing sets.  
3. Standardized features using `StandardScaler`.  
4. Trained Logistic Regression model.  
5. Evaluated using:
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Precision, Recall, Accuracy  
   - ROC Curve & AUC Score  
6. Visualized the Sigmoid Function and threshold effect.

##  Key Insights
- Model achieves >95% accuracy and high ROC-AUC.  
- Precision and recall are well-balanced.  
- Sigmoid curve demonstrates probability-to-class conversion.
